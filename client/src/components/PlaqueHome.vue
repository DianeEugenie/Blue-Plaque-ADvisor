    <h3>Welcome to Blue Plaque Adventure!</h3>
    <p>
      You may have noticed plaques without realizing what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is a plaque? Why are they placed where they are?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, a plaque is a sign that is installed in a public place to commemorate a historical connection between that location, a significant event in history or a famous person. It is a marker of history! You can put up a site for plaque nomination in Scotland through <a href="https://www.historicenvironment.scot/about-us/what-we-do/commemorative-plaque-scheme/#overview_tab">Historic Environment Scotland</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have used the amazing database of <a href="https://openplaques.org/">Open Plaques</a> which is a community-based project made up of volunteers who go out and about to discover, curate and catalogue commemorative plaques and historical markers throughout the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our app takes you on a historic adventure through Glasgow discovering all the plaques, not just the blue ones.
